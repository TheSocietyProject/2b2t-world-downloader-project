project: 2b2t world download


1) plan:

download the 2b2t world to analyze the chunks
I plan to download the overworld and nether and if it's possible also the end.
Let's call the people that want to help with the downloads: loaders.

1.area to download
-the download should go as far as possible but I think the most data will be <~50k
-if there are chunks missing I would average it out with the chunks around it to see the effects


2.sorting the downloaded world
-The files will be saved on github in branches. It could be sorted by user, time or area
-the chunks in between might be saved in a file type designed by me so it doesn't take up as much space as the region files.



2) my goal is to analyze the chunks for interesting things and also with the background to get more information about:

1.Player Activity:
-by sign contents
-by chest contents and other containers (if available -> the container has to be opened in order to be saved)
-by entities like withers (can't promise this works also because 2b2ts plugins fuck with the entity saving on world downloader)
-by what shape the highways are
-by the changes on highways
-by highway density
-by the change in highway density
-by portals (whether they are activated, how much broken, whether their portal blocks face the right direction and how many corners blocks there are)
-by change on every block (in relation to time)
-by number of blocks (cobble, wood, obby, stone, water, lava, portal blocks, farmland, air, bedrock)
-by number of blocks in relation (eg cobble to stone, water to lava)
-by the maximum height, average height and lowest height the blocks in a chunk are
-by chunk borders (for player activity from long ago)
-by how many blocks there are in relation to 0 0 or a highway
-by how much the 2b2t world has changed compared to a newly generated world

2.Chunk Age:
-by sign contents
-by portals (whether they are activated, how much broken, whether their portal blocks face the right direction and how many corners blocks there are)
-by chunk borders
-by blocks in the chunk (some blocks came with updates like eg granite with 1.8)
-obviously, compare how the world is generated with older versions of the 2b2t seed


3.other things to analyze out of interest (will probably be expanded by much)
-sign contents for history about players
-how many spawners are destroyed in some areas
-how much portals r changed
-how much portals r changed in over world compared to nether
-how fast incursion builds get destroyed
-y lvls of portals
-average change in relation to time.
-how many and what monuments are built. Maybe also the lvl of grief of each monument. A monument also includes minor coords like 8k 5k.
